Deep learning is a fairly recent field that has advanced very quickly and has helped us solve a variety of problemsincluding 
detecting diseases, speech recognition, etc. There are few ethical concerns raised over time as tech advances everyday.
Deep learning has made it possible for people to make fake images and videos that are almost impossible for humans to identify them as fake.
Deepfake technology can be wielded as a weapon, posing a significant threat to an individual's social life and reputation, underscoring the 
imperative need for effective detection techniques to identify and prevent the dissemination of such manipulated content. The deep learning 
patterns for this project can help us detect forged videos. With the most common approach to make an imitation video or image involving the 
use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, which are trained together
in a competitive manner. This paper discusses deepfakes and various techniques used to detect manipulated videos and their advantages and 
disadvantages. We put forward a Residual Network (ResNet) model which is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which can be
implemented in Detectron2, MediaPipe, PyTorch,Tensorflow to detect this manipulated content at an equitable accuracy rate.
