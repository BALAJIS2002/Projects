## Insight

blockchain-based deepfake detection system for government tender allocation enhances transparency 
and prevents bribery by securely verifying the authenticity of video submissions. Utilizing SHA-256
for cryptographic security, this approach ensures the integrity and immutability of data. The 
combination of blockchain and deepfake detection strengthens trust in the tender process, as 
SHA-256's robust hashing algorithm safeguards against tampering. This system not only improves
accountability and reduces corruption but also provides a transparent and verifiable record,
ensuring fair and unbiased tender allocation.
